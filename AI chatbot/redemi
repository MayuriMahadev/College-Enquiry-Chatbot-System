Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered chatbot that assists students, parents, and faculty by providing instant responses to inquiries about a college. This chatbot aims to:

Automate Student Support – Reduce manual work by answering frequently asked questions.
Provide Quick and Accurate Information – Deliver instant responses related to admissions, courses, fees, events, and other college-related topics.
Enhance User Experience – Ensure 24/7 availability for students and parents seeking college information.
Reduce Human Workload – Minimize the burden on administrative staff by handling common queries automatically.
Improve Accessibility – Make college-related information more accessible to prospective and current students.
Why is this Project Needed?
Time-Saving – Instead of students waiting in long queues or searching through websites, they get instant answers.
Efficient Inquiry Handling – Helps colleges manage a large volume of student inquiries without requiring additional staff.
Scalability – Can handle thousands of users simultaneously, unlike human representatives.
24/7 Availability – Works at any time without human intervention, ensuring constant support.
User-Friendly – Provides a natural and interactive way for students to ask and receive information.
How to Display the Project?
To effectively present your chatbot system, follow these steps:

Project Demonstration:
